However, the anonymity that fueled the web’s growth has created dangerous blind spots. We collectively recognize that children must be protected from unsuitable content, and that digital spaces require accountability to function safely.\n\nThe current industry response to these challenges is to swing to the extreme of Total Surveillance. To comply with new safety regulations (such as AVMSD and ARCOM requirements), websites are forcing users to upload sensitive identity documents, effectively creating a \"digital checkpoint\" at every URL. This approach solves one safety problem by creating a massive privacy disaster: the \"Data Over-Transmission\" crisis.\n\nPowm proposes a third path. We refuse to accept that safety requires the surrender of privacy. We are building the infrastructure for Proof without Exposure, a neutral, double-blind identity layer that allows users to prove their eligibility (e.g., \"Over 18\") without revealing who they are."

If a user must identify themselves to access adult content or gambling sites, that verification event becomes a data point. This sensitive data, who visited what, is often monetized or leaked, fundamentally violating the user's right to privacy."

Our business model is based on the service of verification itself (a utility model), aligning our incentives with privacy.\n- No Political Agenda: We are a technical intermediary, ensuring the law is respected without expanding the scope of control.\n\nWe believe that by being an independent third party, one that legally and technically cannot see the data, we offer the only viable path to mass adoption.
