To protect minors and enforce accountability, regulators (ARCOM, AVMSD) now demand strict verification, pushing the industry toward a <strong>\"Total Surveillance\"</strong> model where digital checkpoints require sensitive document uploads at every URL.\n\nPowm proposes a third path. We are a next-generation digital identity wallet that solves the two biggest problems in the digital economy: <strong>User Friction</strong> and <strong>Data Liability</strong>.\n\nWe refuse to accept the <strong>\"False Choice\"</strong> between safety and privacy. By allowing users to store their own identity credentials locally and share them via <strong>cryptographic proofs</strong>, Powm enables businesses to verify users instantly without ever handling, seeing, or storing sensitive personal documents."
